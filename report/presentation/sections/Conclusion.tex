\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Achievements:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Modular and maintainable architecture and optimized codebase.
            \item Framework that can be readily extended.
            \item Enhanced user experience with new features (terrain, physics engine, items, \dots).
        \end{itemize}
        \item Tradeoff: out OOP architecture is less performant than flecs.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiplayer modes and leaderboard integration.
        \item New game items and biomes.
        \item Further enhancements to the physics engine:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Improved performance with parallel batch processing and spatial data structures.
            \item Friction and air resistance.
            \item Reduction of jitter.
        \end{itemize}
